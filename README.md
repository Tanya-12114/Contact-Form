## Features

- Responsive two-column layout
- Stylish dark gradient background with SVG dot patterns
- 3D animated image with fade-in effect
- Client-side form validation using JavaScript
- User feedback messages for errors and success
- Smooth transitions and hover effects


## How It Works

- **HTML** handles the layout with a two-column design.
- **CSS** adds gradients, patterns, responsive styling, and animations.
- **JavaScript** validates:
  - Non-empty Name
  - Valid Email (regex-based)
  - Non-empty Message

If the form is valid, it displays a success message. It does not actually send the data.

## Responsive Design

- On smaller screens (â‰¤768px), the form stacks vertically.
- Elements adjust their padding and width automatically.
